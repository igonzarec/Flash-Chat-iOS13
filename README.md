# Flash-Chat

## The Goal

One of the most fundamental component of modern iOS apps is the Table View. Table Views are used everywhere from the Mail app to the Messages app. It’s a crucial part of every iOS developer’s tool belt. In this app I'll be getting to grips with Table Views, creating custom cells, and making my own cloud-based backend database.

## The app

This so named 'Flash Chat' is an internet based messaging app similar to WhatsApp, the popular messaging app that was bought by Facebook for $22 billion. I will be using a service called Firebase Firestore as a backend database to store and retrieve our messages from the cloud. 

## In this app I

* integrate third party libraries in the app using Cocoapods and Swift Package Manager.
* store data in the cloud using Firebase Firestore.
* query and sort the Firebase database.
* use Firebase for user authentication, registration and login.
* work with UITableViews and set their data sources and delegates.
* create custom views using .xib files to modify native design components.
* embed View Controllers in a Navigation Controller and manipulate the navigation stack.
* create a constants file and use static properties to store Strings and other constants.
* handle Swift loops and create animations using loops.
* tap into some App's Lifecycle methods such as viewWillAppear or viewWillDisappear.
* create direct Segues for navigation.
